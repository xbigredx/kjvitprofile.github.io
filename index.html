        <h1>My IT Profile</h1>
        <h2>What is My interest in IT</h2>
        <p>My interest in IT started when I was about 6 or so when I was given the original PlayStation for my birthday. This came with the first Crash Bandicoot game which I played until I nearly killed it. From there on, 
            I was always interested in video games playing them by myself with friends. When I was a little older, I was given a hand me down laptop from my parents and I started to mess around with it. From there on that is where my interest in computers and computer hardware started. 
            They offered a one term programming project at my high school which I took, and I aced the class achieving full marks. Upon reflection of that, I should have realized that I should have gone straight into IT from there but chose not to. 

            While I do not have any professional IT experience, I do however quite a bit of experience in building computers having built the one I am typing this very report on as well some others for family and friends. 
            The reason that I decided to take these subjects at RMIT is that lately, I have not been feeling very satisfied in my current line of work and have decided that is time for a change in career trajectory. 
            Taking this and the introduction to programming course will hopefully inspire to discover what I truly want to do in the IT field so that I can pursue it even further.
