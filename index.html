        <h1>My IT Profile</h1>
        <p>Hello there. My name is Kyle. I am currently studying at RMIT university.</p>
        <img src="ME.jpg">
        <h2>What is My interest in IT</h2>
        <p>My interest in IT started when I was about 6 or so when I was given the original PlayStation for my birthday. This came with the first Crash Bandicoot game which I played until I nearly killed it. From there on, 
            I was always interested in video games playing them by myself with friends. When I was a little older, I was given a hand me down laptop from my parents and I started to mess around with it. From there on that is where my interest in computers and computer hardware started. 
            They offered a one term programming project at my high school which I took, and I aced the class achieving full marks. Upon reflection of that, I should have realized that I should have gone straight into IT from there but chose not to. 
        </p>
        <p> I do not have any professional IT experience, I do however quite a bit of experience in building computers having built the one I am typing this very report on as well some others for family and friends. 
        The reason that I decided to take these subjects at RMIT is that lately, I have not been feeling very satisfied in my current line of work and have decided that is time for a change in career trajectory. 
        Taking this and the introduction to programming course will hopefully inspire to discover what I truly want to do in the IT field so that I can pursue it even further.
        </p>
        <h2>My Ideal IT Job</h2>    
        <p>As mentioned previously, I currently do not have an exact field of IT that I would be interest in, hence why I am taking the course to try and find what my calling in life is to be. 
        However, upon pulling up an advertisement on seek for a local ad in the IT industry I would look at that and what the requirements would be to perform this role.</p>
        <p>I have added the screen grab of the image in case the link is broken</p>
            <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51786487?type=staASsigndard#searchRequestToken=c3f8df68-a1ba-449b-b0d3-c7d2d817c637">This a link to the advertisement</a>
        <img src="SEEK JOB.png">
        <p>Upon looking at that job advertisement it is a problem-solving based role as it involves troubleshooting problems based on networks. It also involved maintain a portfolio of technology systems which includes different computer hardware as well making sure that all documentation is up to date on the network. 
            Given that this role is considered a junior position it does not require the level of experience that I normal network engineer would require. However, there are some certifications needed to be even considered for the position, these include some cisco certifications as well as network + and A+ certification. 
            Currently I do not possess any of requirements that this position asks for. Continuing with these studies will be the first step in being able to fulfill these requirements. Another part of the plan would be working towards obtaining the necessary certifications. These certifications would demonstrate that I am able to fulfill the necessary tasks that go with being a network engineer. </p>
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>Myers Briggs test result – <a href= "https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality#:~:text=A%20Logician%20(INTP)%20is%20someone,to%20experiment%20with%20personal%20creativity.">'The Logician’</a> or INTP
            Learning style test result – ‘Auditory’
            Adobe Creative Style test result – ‘The Thinker’
            </p>
            <p>For me, these test results show that my personality reflects a lot around analyzing a problem and working out all the possible solutions that could happen in that situation. this means that I need to be mindful about not letting my mind run away with its thoughts and try to live in the present. Something I know that I am not very good at. I also need to allow more time for projects to get done as I find that my energy levels can be very sporadic at the best of times. A positive aspect of this personality type is that I can create a solution that may not be the most common approach. </p>
            <p>When working in a team environment, I do not tend to take a leader role in group work, I would rather focus my time and energy into solving what has been in front of me. I am quite okay with people being able to do their own work and I do not need to control every aspect of the group. With that being said, I know that I can become frustrated quite easily when others work does not meet the expectations that I have set myself in my head. 

            </p>
            <p>When forming a team, there a couple of things that I need to consider. The first one is that I need to ensure that I am working on a team that values everyone as equals, this generally creates a calm and conflict-free work environment which I prefer rather than everyone arguing with each other and trying to pull rank over one another. Another aspect to consider as part of a team is around the working environment, given that I can find that my energy levels can be very sporadic, I generally favor a work environment that is flexible as that means I can do the work when the energy levels are on a high. Compared to being in a rigid environment where sometimes my output will not be fantastic as my energy level is on a low.  

            </p>
            <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The idea behind my project is quite simple. Given the amount of demand for building and construction within the area I live in. Things are starting to get complicated and reading house plans can be difficult at the best of times. My proposal is an augmented reality system that allows the builder to be able to see the house plans on the building site in real time. This system will allow the contractors to see exactly where specific elements of the house will be located, elements such as light fixtures, PowerPoints, internal walls etc.
